Quiz Manager Web

We have used servlets and JSPs. You will neeed to Tomcat server for your eclipse.
We have used DERBY database. You would need to modify the properties of the database in the applicationcontext file under the header datasource.
There is also a need to add quizmanager as a librarby dependency to this project.
